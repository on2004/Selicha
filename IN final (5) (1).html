The desert winds bite sharper than you remember.

Selicha rides home at last, the old sands whispering news he already knows.

King Sharaman, Selichas father, is dead.
Nizar, once his trusted hand, now sits the throne without coronation, without mourning.

When Selicha learned the truth, they sent blades to silence him.
They found Bakur alongside him. His trusted right hand man.

Together, they left the sands red behind them. Now, only the city remains.

Basileon which was once the jewel of empires, now rises on the horizon, broken and bleeding.

Thrones may fall. Names may fade.
But vengeance endures.

[[Continue your return to the city]]

}
&lt;/style&gt;The sun bleeds low behind the towers of Basileon, painting the gates in shadow and gold.

Selicha and Bakur ride closer, cloaks drawn, blood dry on their blades.

They knew something was wrong.

The guards wear new colors. Crimson stitched with the twin lion and flame.
Nazar’s mark. Raised even before Selichas father fell.

They dismount.

The gate captain steps forward, gaze empty. Not fearful.
Worse, obedient.

&quot;Name and purpose?&quot; he asks, voice flat.

Selicha rules this land by blood. And yet the wind no longer carries his name.

Bakur leans close.
&quot;We need to get inside before nightfall. They won’t open the gates for ghosts.&quot;

How will YOU enter Basileon?

[[Deception — Pose as a merchant, buy passage with gold and lies.]]

[[Stealth — Wait for dusk and scale the forgotten aqueducts of your youth.]]

[[Force — Name yourself, demand entry, and draw steel if needed.]]

[[Bakur’s Plan — Bakur feigns injury, pleading sanctuary. (Play as Bakur)]]

}
&lt;/style&gt;
Basileon hums with smoke and suspicion.

Banners of the red flame snap over every dome, every gate.

In the markets, whispers coil through the air .Not your name, but a warning.
Someone returns. Someone watched.

You.

Faces turn away. Eyes find the ground.

In the distance, the palace sprawls like a serpent fat on stolen gold.

You have little time, and fewer friends.

Where will you go?

 [[Find Kharon — the old swordmaster who once called you son.-&gt;Mission Swordmaster]]
 [[Visit your mother&#39;s shrine — the only place that still carries your scent. -&gt;Mission Shrine]]

&lt;/style&gt;You Are Bakur Now
Selicha waits beyond the gates, a ghost stranded in the sand.

Inside Basileon, you carry the flame now. Alone, hunted, breathing the enemy’s air.

The guard who let you pass already doubles back, suspicion sharp in his step.

If you don&#39;t vanish soon, questions will follow.
Or worse.

You remember Selicha’s words:
If separated, find the Iron Courtyard.

Old ground. Old ghosts. Maybe old allies.

But other paths call too...

Where will you go?

 [[Head for the Iron Courtyard — find Dalin, the last of the old guard. (Mission Courtyard)-&gt;Mission Courtyard]]
[[Take shelter with your cousin — a palace healer with dangerous ties. (Mission Healer-&gt;Mission Healer]]

  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
&lt;/style&gt;You move through the back alleys of Basileon, past crumbling sandstone towers and rusted iron gates, until you find it —
the training yard where blades once sang like bells.

It is cracked now. Silent.

At its center stands a man, hunched at the shoulders, polishing a blade that has seen too many wars.

&quot;You walk like a stranger,&quot; he says, without looking up.

You halt. The wind carries the smell of dust and old iron.

&quot;But you carry your father’s weight.&quot;

He lifts his gaze. One eye cloudy, the other still sharp as broken glass.
Kharon , Bladefather of Basileon.

He taught you how to kill  and when not to.

&quot;The city eats its children now,&quot; he murmurs. &quot;You still fight from the shadows, boy?&quot;

You nod once.

Kharon presses a dagger into your hand,on of black steel where old glyphs are etched deep along the spine.

&quot;It’s not for show,&quot; he says. &quot;It’s for finishing.&quot;

Before you turn to leave, his grip clamps around your forearm.

&quot;Don’t go to the palace yet. If you want truth, find it where the empire rots loudest, the Water Market.&quot;
(set: $hasDagger to true)
[[Slip into the Water Market with Kharon’s warning burning in your mind -&gt;Mission Market]]

  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
&lt;/style&gt;you kneel at the shrine tucked between broken marble columns, the scent of old incense clinging to the stone.

An old woman approaches wearing tattered robes with her hands trembling.

She draws symbols in ash across your palms, her voice shifting into a chant, thin as a dying flame.

Your vision blurs.

Flames rise against the palace walls. Nazar’s face appears, but behind him — something worse.
A crown of fire. A shadow too large to name. 

Then, a voice very soft, unmistakable:

&quot;Don’t fight him in the light,&quot; your mother whispers. &quot;Shadows remember more.&quot;

You wake.
Blood smears your hands. 
Not your own.

The woman is gone.
Only silence remains.

Far away, the bells of the Water Market toll like warnings in the wind.

[[Head toward the Water Market – the streets whisper your name-&gt;Mission Market]]

&lt;style&gt;

  background-size: cover;

  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
&lt;/style&gt;The Water Market was never just a market.

It was the empire’s second heart where kings bought silence and rebels bought fire.

Now it stinks of fear.

You slip beneath a spice merchant’s stall, into the Blackwater Den.

The old faces are gone.
In their place: steel, scars, and suspicion.

At the far table, a woman watches you with sharp-eyes, coiled like a snake.

Nalia. 
Rebel broker. One-time assassin of your father’s court.

&quot;You’re supposed to be dead,&quot; she says, voice like crushed gravel.

You sit.
She leans closer, words barely a whisper.

&quot;The rebellion breathes, barely. But Nazar moves at dawn where five nobles to hang for treason. One of them&#39;s just a child.&quot;

Your stomach tightens. You knew those faces.
They bled for your father&#39;s banner.

Nalia slides a map across the table, her fingers lingering a moment on the edge.

&quot;You&#39;ll need a blade,&quot; she mutters, then sees the dagger already strapped at your belt.

She grins, sharp and humorless.

&quot;Good. Looks like you came prepared.&quot;

She leans closer, voice dropping to a growl.

&quot;We can stop the execution. But we’ll burn half the square to do it.&quot;

Now you must choose your path:

 [[Lead a rebel assault — bold, brutal, loud. Save them or die trying-&gt;Mission Raid]]
[[Infiltrate alone — strike unseen, one blade, one moment. -&gt;Mission Infiltration]]

 &lt;style&gt;

  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
&lt;/style&gt;You walk like you belong with your head down, cloak clean, steps measured and fast.

In Basileon’s palace district, wealth wears a dozen faces: merchant princes in silk, courtesans in embroidered veils, officers in black lacquered armor.

You drift among them, catching broken whispers.

&quot;Nazar plans something,&quot; one voice hisses. &quot;An execution. Something loud.&quot;

&quot;What of Selicha?&quot; another asks.

&quot;Dead,&quot; a third voice snaps. &quot;Or will be soon enough.&quot;

You push deeper until a palace scribe catches your eye, suspicion sharpening.

Yout then vanish fast through a garden gate, over a wall, down into the old stone tunnels.

Two quick knocks on a hidden door.

It creaks open.
Dalin stands there, grinning like a man who never forgot how to bleed.

&quot;You’ve been busy,&quot; he says.

[[Enter the Iron Courtyard – the rebellion breathes here-&gt;Mission Courtyard]]

&lt;style&gt;

  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
&lt;/style&gt;Beneath the shattered stones of Basileon, the rebellion barely breathes .

Dalin, scarred and sharp-eyed, rises first.
Velka leans on a broken spear, her face like carved stone.
Aza watches from the shadows, arms crossed, distrust flashing in his glare.
Thomil fingers a rusted amulet, whispering to gods no one names anymore.

None of them move to embrace you.

Too many funerals. Too many lies.

You step into the broken amphitheater, the city&#39;s bones groaning around you.

&quot;Selicha lives,&quot; you say.

Silence.
Heavy. Doubting.

Until you toss Selicha’s blood-marked crest onto the table.

Gasps.
Curses.
Thomil laughs once , sharp and wild.

&quot;Then it’s not over,&quot; Velka breathes.
&quot;And neither is the fight.&quot;

Dalin grips your shoulder, rough as gravel.

&quot;Nazar’s forces are stretched thin,&quot; he says. &quot;We strike tonight and burn the western depot, break his spine before he tightens the noose.&quot;

Aza steps forward, voice like a knife in water.
&quot;Or we wait. Let Bakur slip into the palace circle.
Tear him apart from inside — slow, sure.&quot;

The rebellion waits for your word.

Which fire do you light?

[[Command an assault — burn the supply depot, ignite open rebellion. -&gt;Mission Assault]]
 [[Infiltrate the palace — gather secrets, sow collapse from within. -&gt;Mission Spy]]
 
 &lt;style&gt;

  background-size: cover;

  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
&lt;/style&gt;You slip through the crumbling lanes of the healer’s district where blood and secrets are stitched behind closed doors.

Rima still tends the last green house, the old way.
You knock: two quick, one slow.

She opens the door and slaps you across the face.

&quot;You look like war,&quot; she mutters.

Then she pulls you inside.

She stitches a gash you hadn&#39;t noticed, shoves bread into your hand, says nothing.
Not at first.

But when she sees the seal tucked in your satchel, Selicha’s crest, her fingers tremble.

&quot;They said he was dead,&quot; she whispers. &quot;I prayed they lied.&quot;

You say nothing. Silence weighs more than any answer.

She leans close.

&quot;Dalin still meets in the Iron Courtyard,&quot; she says. &quot;But he’s grown careful. Shadows don’t earn trust anymore, Bakur.&quot;

She presses a small vial into your palm ,a clear liquid with a sharp scent.

&quot;Poison or medicine,&quot; she says. &quot;Depends which hand holds it.&quot;

[[Slip through the back alleys toward the Iron Courtyard-&gt;Mission Courtyard]]

&lt;style&gt;

}
&lt;/style&gt;You raise the rebel blade high, the heart of the Water Market pounding in your ears.

&quot;We strike tonight.&quot;

Nalia nods once. The others scatter like embers, vanishing into the city.

Word spreads fast.
By nightfall, you lead them. Slipping through alleys, climbing rooftops toward the Gallows of Mourning, where Nazar’s rule sharpens its teeth.

Dawn breaks over a square packed with bodies.

The first prisoner is dragged forward. The blade rises.

And then,
The fire starts.

Screams tear through the smoke. Your rebels fall on the guards like wolves.

You fight ,brutal and desperatly cutting down the executioner, shattering chains.

One noble freed.
Another.

Then — the horn.

The Red Lions arrive in a wall of red and iron.

Crossbows snap.

You are hit.
Once.
Twice.
A third time.

You fall against the gallows you meant to tear down.

The last thing you see is the crowd
Not cheering.
Not mourning.

Watching.

Waiting to see if you will rise.

You don&#39;t.

Selicha falls.
The rebellion burns.
Nazar crowns himself divine.

[[DEATHH]]

}
&lt;/style&gt;You move like smoke, silent and unseen.

The gallows loom ahead, guards posted thick around the edges but not perfect.

You slip behind a butcher’s cart, then beneath the stage.

Breath slow.
Heart slower.

Above, the executioner calls for silence. A blade rises.

You strike before it falls.

A flicker of steel.
A red bloom across his throat.

Gasps break from the crowd as the executioner crumples, choking on his own blood.

You vanish into smoke before anyone can shout your name.

The noose swings empty over a silent square.

Later, in the alleyways, Nalia finds you.

&quot;They’ll panic now,&quot; she says. &quot;But the fire hasn’t started yet. We bought time.&quot;

She presses a scroll into your hand, wrapped in red twine.

&quot;You’re not done. There’s something happening beneath the palace. A contact waits. You’ll find him soon.&quot;

[[Enter the Shadow Room-&gt;Mission Convergence]]

}
&lt;/style&gt;You take the torch from Dalin’s calloused hand.

&quot;We light the spark,&quot; you say. &quot;Now.&quot;

That night, you ride with half a dozen rebels. Silent shadows racing toward the Western Supply Depot, where Nazar hoards food, weapons, and chained deserters.

You scale the back wall under a moon thin as a blade.

Two guards fall without sound.
Flasks of fire-oil slide into place beneath the carts.

Then a whistle.

&quot;Bakur,&quot; someone hisses.
&quot;It’s a trap.&quot;

Aza’s scouts never returned. They had been turned.

A bell tolls loud and  brutal.

Flames bloom

A tower collapses.
Rebels scatter, burning and screaming through the smoke.

You push forward. Light the oil.
The supply cache explodes in a thunder that shakes the ground.

A small victory. A broken prayer.

Your leg is shattered. Blood fills your mouth.

Through the rubble, a figure walks with crimson-caped, blade in hand.

Nazar.

&quot;You think this stops the tide?&quot; he says, soft and cold.
&quot;You were never the storm.&quot;

His blade drives through your chest.

Your last breath rises as smoke into the broken night.

Bakur falls.
The rebellion bleeds into silence.
Selicha fights alone.

[[DEATHH]]

}
&lt;/style&gt;Rima gave you the tools. A cleaner cloak, a servant’s incense, a forged mark of loyalty.

You slip into the palace with the treasurers’ messengers.

No one looks at you twice.
That is the power of walking small.

You memorize steps. Doors. Keys. Faces that wear too many lies.

Nights pass in silence.

Until one evening, hidden among the library vaults, you hear it:

&quot;The ritual must be completed before the next eclipse.&quot;

&quot;But the vessel?&quot;

&quot;It’s already inside the city. They just don’t know it yet.&quot;

Your hand grips the shelf tight.

They aren’t planning a war.
They are planning a transformation.

Something old and hungry.

Aza finds you before you slip away.

&quot;We got your message,&quot; she whispers. &quot;The others are waiting.&quot;

She pulls a lever hidden behind the sun god’s statue.

A stairwell gapes open, descending into darkness.

[[Enter the Shadow Room-&gt;Mission Convergence]]

}
&lt;/style&gt;Deep beneath Basileon, the stones sweat with old secrets.

A cracked table with Six candles burning low.
Three rebels and two strangers you do not know or trust.

One empty seat that seems to be waiting for you.

Maps sprawl across the surface marked with supply lines, escape tunnels, sealed chambers beneath the palace.

Runes line the walls, half-swallowed by moss and rot.

Somewhere beneath your feet, something shifts.

Not a man.
Not a crown.
Something older than the city itself.

This is no longer about thrones or rebellion.

It is about what Basileon has become.

}
&lt;/style&gt;You sit in the Shadow Room.

Candles gutter low and whispers crawl along the stone walls.
Maps lie scattered before you with lines drawn in blood and desperate ink.

&quot;Nazar isn’t just reaching for power anymore,&quot; Aza says, voice brittle.
&quot;He’s preparing a ritual — hidden beneath the palace, in the oldest catacombs.&quot;

Dalin leans over the table, hands clenched into fists.

&quot;He doesn’t want to rule,&quot; he says.
&quot;He wants to become something the city can never forget.
A name that outlives us all.&quot;

You have little time.

The eclipse draws near.
Once it passes, there will be no undoing what Nazar becomes.

Choose how you strike:

[[[Rally the last rebels — storm the tunnels, risk everything in open battle. -&gt;Mission RaidTunnels]]

}
&lt;/style&gt;You lead the last charge into the dark.

Rebels pour down the broken stairways, their torches burning like falling stars.

Some die in the first corridor and arrows come from hidden slits.
Others push forward, shoulder to shoulder, hungry for a future they may never see.

The walls pulse with heat and chants throb through the stone.
The air tastes of blood and iron.

At the altar’s base, Nazar stands.

His skin glows faint gold.
His eyes are milk-white.

&quot;You are late,&quot; he says, voice almost gentle.

He raises his hand.

The room tilts and groans, reality bending at the seams.
[[Face Nizar in open battle-&gt;Mission ThroneRoom]]

&lt;/style&gt;You move like a breath between broken stones.

Five loyal shadows at your side.

One falls before you reach the altar from a blade in the dark, a cry swallowed by the earth.

The others hold the line, fighting unseen battles behind you.

You slip forward , alone toward the heart of the rot.

There, beneath the crumbling throne, you find him.

Nazar floats inches above the ground, chanting words the stone itself seems to fear.

A crown of ash turns above his head.

&quot;I waited for you,&quot; he says.

He does not draw a sword.

He draws the shadows themselves.

[[Face Nizar in final confrontation-&gt;Mission ThroneRoom]]

&lt;/style&gt;Nizar&#39;s body is only partly human now.

Symbols writhe across his skin  old marks, from gods the city forgot how to fear.

You circle him.

He floats inches above the ground, robes trailing like smoke.
Flames crackle behind his teeth when he speaks.

&quot;I did what your father never had the courage to do,&quot; he says.
&quot;I became something they cannot kill. I became memory.&quot;

You say nothing.

You draw your blade.

The stone beneath you groans.
The air bends under the weight of what he has become.

This is the end.

Choose your final move:

&lt;/style&gt;Blades clash in the flickering dark.

You bleed.
He bleeds.

Nizar is bloated with stolen power ,a man stretched thin by forces he could not command.

You are sharpened by pain, by memory, by the long road that brought you here.

At the final breath, you do not strike for the heart.

You strike the chain at his wrist at the last link binding him to the ritual.

It shatters.

Nazar screams as his body burns from within, flames devouring the shape he tried to wear.

When the ash settles, you step forward  not an heir, not a weapon but something the city must now name.

[[You become a legend-&gt;Ending Crowned]]

&lt;/style&gt;You slip into the breathing dark behind him.

The dagger Kharon gave you is weightless in your hand — a memory of simpler wars.

Nazar floats ahead, chanting words that bleed into the stone.

His back is bare.  
His wrist glows faintly — a binding sigil etched into his skin.

You have one chance to strike.

*The heart beats strong. The wrist hums with power.*  
*Which one holds the true danger?*

**Where do you strike?**

- [[Strike at his heart ]]
- [[Strike at his wrist.]]

}
&lt;/style&gt;
The sun rises over a broken palace.

You step into the throne room through ash, through blood, through silence.

There is no ceremony, no trumpets, no priest to name you.

Only a city watching.

And you not as prince, not exile, not soldier 
something the city could not kill, and could never forget.

Some say you ruled in peace.
Others whisper you vanished again, walking back into the dust and myth.

But all agree on one thing:

You were not only a man.

You were a storm that remembered its name.

THE END

You lower your hood, bow lightly . The way foreign traders do in Nuradun’s crowded markets.

&quot;Selich Al-Ramin, from the desert coast,&quot; you say, voice low. &quot;I bear silks and stones for the palace.&quot;

The guard narrows his eyes.
Bakur steps forward, silent, playing the obedient servant.

A purse of coins shifts from your hand to the guard’s.

Gold, it seems, speaks louder than memory.

&quot;Go in,&quot; he mutters. &quot;And stay out of trouble.&quot;

You pass beneath the black iron archway, into the city that once called you prince. Now foreign, veiled in lies and smoke.

&lt;/style&gt;You and Bakur pull away from the gates, cloaks low, horses silent.

At the city’s cracked edge, the old aqueduct rises. The one you once raced across as a boy chasing the wind.

As dusk falls, you climb the worn limestone, ivy brushing your hands, slipping through broken arches overhead.

Below, guards laugh and speak your name like a curse.

You crest the wall.
Basileon sprawls before you — fractured gold, smoke rising, banners you do not recognize.

You drop into the streets.
Unseen.
Unwelcome.
But within.

&quot;I am Selicha !  blood of Sharaman, heir of Basileon! Open these gates before I tear them down!&quot;

Bakur stiffens. The guards exchange glances, not fear.
Recognition.

The captain lifts a hand.

Arrows fly.

One strikes your chest. Another your throat.

You fall, blood blooming black across stone.

Nuradun forgets your name.

You have failed.

&quot;Please,&quot; he gasps. &quot;My master. Wounded by raiders near the southern pass. I must reach his cousin’s house in the bronze district.&quot;

The guard squints, weighing the lie.

&quot;He walks fine,&quot; one mutters.

&quot;Shock,&quot; Bakur swears. &quot;By gods.&quot;

A long pause.

&quot;You,&quot; the captain says. &quot;Come. The rider stays.&quot;

Your hand finds your hilt, you are ready but Bakur’s glance stops you.

You clasp forearms.

&quot;If they kill you,&quot; you whisper, &quot;I will burn this gate behind you.&quot;

Bakur nods once.

He is swallowed by the gate.

You are left outside, a ghost at your own walls.


[[Now you are Bakur – inside the lion’s den-&gt;Bakur In City]]

&lt;/style&gt;Your blade sinks true — into Nazar&#39;s chest.

His body crumples.

But the ritual bursts free, blooming from the blood.  
You feel it — a curse, spreading like rot into the bones of Basileon.

Nazar is dead.  
But the city is damned.

[[DEATHHH]]

}
&lt;/style&gt;
Your blade slices clean through the glowing sigil.

Nazar gasps — not from pain, but from unraveling.  
The ritual collapses inward, consuming the spell before it can root.

The legend he tried to carve into stone dies before it is born.

When the echoes fade, you stand alone — not crowned by blood, but by survival.

[[Ending Crowned]]
